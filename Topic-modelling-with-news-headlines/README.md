### Project Overview

 You have a dataset of news headlines sourced from the reputable Australian news source ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corp.) over a period of 15 years.
The main goal of this problem is to leverage the power of techniques like LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to assign topics to unseen news headlines.

Stopword Removal
POS Tagging
Latent Semantic Analysis
